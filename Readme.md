 What is Topic Modelling?
 Topic modeling can be easily compared to clustering. As in the case of clustering, the number of topics, like the number of clusters, 
 is a hyperparameter. By doing topic modeling we build clusters of words rather than clusters of texts. A text is thus a mixture of 
 all the topics, each having a certain weight. In this repository i have uploaded basic Topic Modelling techniques LDA (Latent Dirchele Allocation) and LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis).
